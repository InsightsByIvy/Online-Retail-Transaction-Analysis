# Online Retail Transaction Analysis

This project focuses on data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualisation. It analyses online retail transaction data to understand and to provide insights intocustomer behaviour, identify popular products, and optimise pricing and marketing strategies.

## Dataset Content
The dataset contains information on customer transactions made through an online retail platform. It includes data on products purchased, quantities, transaction dates and times, prices, customer identifiers, and customer locations. 

## Business Requirements
* Increase sales performance (Identify which products are selling the most and which are underperforming)
* Understand customer behavior (Identify high-value customers and frequent buyers for loyalty programs)
* Improve marketing campaigns (Understand which types of products perform best in specific regions)
* Optimise pricing strategies (Spot opportunities for discounts or price increases)

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

## Project Plan
High-Level Steps Taken:
* Data Collection (Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle as a .csv file and imported it into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas)
* Data Processing (ETL)
* Data Analysis & Interpretation (Visualized sales trends by country, product category and transactions over time)

Data Management:
* Data was managed using Pandas DataFrames throughout the entire process.
* Cleaning and transformation steps were kept in structured Jupyter cells for transparency and readability.
* Any modifications were tested and visualized immediately to ensure correctness.

Research Methodologies Used:
* I used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) because this project was focused on uncovering patterns, trends, and insights in the data.
* I chose data visualization techniques (bar plots, histograms, line charts, box plots) to help interpret the data in a meaningful and visual way.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
The goal of this project was to support business decisions by transforming raw transaction data into actionable insights. Each data visualisation was designed with a specific business question or requirement in mind to make the analysis relevant and valuable. Hereâ€™s how they were mapped:
 - Identify best-selling products: 
   Bar chart showing top-selling products by total sales volume or revenue that helps marketing and inventory teams focus on popular items.
 - Explore customer distribution by country:
   Bar chart or pie chart showing total sales by country. Useful for targeting specific international markets or evaluating regional performance.
 - Transactions over time:
   Line chart showing ...

## Analysis techniques used
List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
The dataset is used for this analysis does not cointain any private or sensitive information.

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* pandas is used for data exploration and clearning.
* matplotlib is used for visualisation.
* seaborn is used for visualisation.
* plotly is used for interactive visualisation.

## Credits
* The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
* The template for this project was provided by Code Institue.
* I used Code Institute learning materials to review visualisation techniques.
* Perplexity AI was used for data clarification and code review.
