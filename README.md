## Dataset Content
The dataset contains information on customer transactions made through an online retail platform. It includes data on products purchased, quantities, transaction dates and times, prices, customer identifiers, and customer locations. 

## Business Requirements
* Increase sales performance (Identify which products are selling the most and which are underperforming)
* Understand customer behavior (Identify high-value customers and frequent buyers for loyalty programs)
* Improve marketing campaigns (Understand which types of products perform best in specific regions)
* Optimise pricing strategies (Spot opportunities for discounts or price increases)

## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them)

## Project Plan

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
The goal of this project was to support business decisions by transforming raw transaction data into actionable insights. Each data visualisation was designed with a specific business question or requirement in mind to make the analysis relevant and valuable. Hereâ€™s how they were mapped:
* Identify best-selling products: 

## Analysis techniques used
List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
The dataset is used for this analysis does not cointain any private or sensitive information.

## Main Data Analysis Libraries
